To run the tests:

1- Clone the project

2- Run "bundle install"

3- Run "cucumber -f html -o Results.html -f progress" (you can change this command depending on what format you want the output to be in)

4- An HTML report will be generated in the root folder which contains all the test results

Note: you need to have Ruby and Bundler on your machine
